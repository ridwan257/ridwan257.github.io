<p>
    I have a great facination on simulation. 
    When I have enrolled in my undergraduate program, I was thinking to make some physics simualtion that i learned in high school.
    I first got my laptop from my father that time. I know a little bit of C and Java I have learned in high school and I
    dont have any idea about computer graphics. At that time, i was highly inspired by a book 
    <a class="w3-wide" href="https://natureofcode.com">The Nature of Code</a> by Daniel Shiffman. 
    He was using <a href="https://p5js.org">p5.js</a> library, i found it highly intersting. Later I was introduced to 
    <a href="https://www.pygame.org/">pygame</a> library of python and thinking that why not try to customize pygame like p5. 
    Though it was not succesfull, but i modulalize some functionality and made some Simulation.

    All of this code is avaibale in <a class="w3-wide" href="https://github.com/ridwan257/Simulations">GitHub Repository</a>.

    <h2>Matrix Rain Simulation</h2>
    <p>
        It is just simulatting a scence of Matrix Movie.
