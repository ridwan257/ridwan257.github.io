<p>
    I have a great facination on simulation. 
    When I have enrolled in my undergraduate program, I was thinking to make some physics simualtion that i learned in high school.
    I first got my laptop from my father that time. I know a little bit of C and Java I have learned in high school and I
    dont have any idea about computer graphics. At that time, i was highly inspired by a book 
    <a class="w3-wide" href="https://natureofcode.com">The Nature of Code</a> by Daniel Shiffman. 
    He was using <a href="https://p5js.org">p5.js</a> library, i found it highly intersting. Later I was introduced to 
    <a href="https://www.pygame.org/">pygame</a> library of python and thinking that why not try to customize pygame like p5. 
    Though it was not succesfull, but i modulalize some functionality and made some Simulation.

<h5>Name of Simulations</h5>
<ul>
    <li><a href="#mrain">Matrix Rain</a></li>
    <li><a href="#finding-target">Path Searching using Genetic Algorithm</a></li>
    <li><a href="#rocket">Rocket in search of moon using Genetic Algorithm</a></li>
    <li><a href="#gdescent">Gradient Descent Progreesion</a></li>
    <li><a href="#traveling-ant">Traveling Salesman using Ant Colony Optimization Algorithm</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Matrix Rain Simulation</h2>
<p>
    It is the most simplest simualtion.
